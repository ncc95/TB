# TB
Initial TB repository

Module dependencies:
 -opencv
 -numpy

This is the initial working pipeline to iterate through image files in a folder and perform image thresholding

If iterate_through_files.py is called (in the same directory as threshold_function.py and the images to be analysed) it will iterate through all JPG files in the directory and perform thresholding.
